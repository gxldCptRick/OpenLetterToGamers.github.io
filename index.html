Everything we do from the games we buy to the ones we don't is a direct response to the game development community that is the way they can tell whether or not to make a new halo or a new game altogether. This is why even when we complain about these games they won't listen because money is louder then words. The only way to communicate is through our purchases. If we keep funding bad games the  juggernauts of the industry will keep making terrible games or even just the same game rehashed over and over again because it makes them money. I'm not trying to say that all the games they make are bad just that they end up being glitchy and sometimes rendering them unplayable. We need to realize that the effect of always wanting the new game now makes them rush production and leaves these holes in gameplay to ruin the lives of some of the gamers that live for the next big thing. We need to show the developers that we as customers will be able to wait for them and we shouldn't encourage yearly games by pre-ordering the newest games and buying them before they are even out. The pre-order in and of itself is a way that individuals can get reassurance of payment before they even make anything useful and thus causes the developer to think to himself that he doesn't even need to do anything good because he already has been paid. Why would he need to put in the effort theoretically speaking if he has already received the award. This is the main cause of the problems in the gaming community. We need to unite together and boycott pre-orders because this pattern will only continue We need to think about our effect on the games.

We need to unite together and boycott pre-orders because this pattern will only continue if we keep pre-ordering in general. This will stop publishers from either rushing the game or not even producing the game that was promised. We also need to give credit to where it is due when it comes to indie games and their cool ideas. If we want to have a game community with amazing games we need to support the little guys doing the hard work to make them. If we all contribute to this we all stop buying so fast and demanding so much really fast then we will all have better games and even better dlc. The only way they will listen is if we speak with our wallets and force them to change this.
