Everything we do from the games we buy to the ones we don't is a direct response to the game development community that is the way they can tell whether or not to make a new halo or a new game altogether. This is why even when we complain about these games they won't listen because money is louder then words. The only way to communicate is through our purchases. If we keep funding this the  juggernauts of the industry will keep making terrible games or even just the same game rehashed over and over again because it makes them money guarnteed </p>
