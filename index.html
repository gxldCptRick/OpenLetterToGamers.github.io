                <h1 class = "col-12">Dear Gamers,</h1>
            </div>
            <div class = "row block first">

                <p class = "col-10 notViewed animBlock floatr" data-position = "right">We need to start to think about our effect on video games. From the games we buy to the games we don’t we are sending a message to game developers about what we want. This is How they decide what to make like a new COD, Halo or even a new game altogether.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "row block">
                <div class = "space col-1"></div>
                 <p  data-position = "left" class = "col-10 notViewed animBlock floatl">Lately, We have seen them taking advantage of us recently with Batman: Arkham Knight where an entire game was rendered completely unplayable due to some problems with how they made the game causing it to crash continuously after 10 minutes into the game or even when it started . This situation was further worsened by the fact that they pushed the game's release date back a whole 2 months beforehand to ensure this wouldn’t be an issue. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "row block">
                <div class = "space col-1 floatr"></div>
                <p data-position = "right" class = "col-10 animBlock notViewed floatr">This was not the first nor last time game developers release a game like this. Another prime example of the rush of the game developers was with the Assassin’s Creed series in which after the third installment of the series, Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, took a downward spiral and became less and less polished while inversely being produced more frequently. After every iteration of the game the gameplay got less fluid and more robotic causing the game to really not have the immersion it once had while also giving rise to glitches like spots where the characters would fall through the map to outside of the play area or it would cause the game to crash randomly while playing or worse yet to have the game suddenly corrupt your save and losing all the time you put into it.</p>

            <div class = "row block">
                <div class = "space col-1"></div>
                <p data-position = "left" class = "col-10 animBlock notViewed">We need to start using the power we have over them, our money. Money is paramount in this day and age to survive and is the best method and seemingly only method to make these giant corporations take our concerns seriously. We must remember to see these game companies as companies so they have a focus on turning a profit even at the cost of the consumer so we as the consumer must force them to make a game that is worth playing. One of these corporations, Nintendo, however, tries to reverse that by making the same games but making them a lot better with each iteration and improving on an already good product but they lack innovation in new games because of this focus on refinement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "row block">
                <div class = "space col-1 floatr"></div>
                <p data-position = "right" class = "col-10 animBlock notViewed floatr">The size of these corporations forces us to look elsewhere to due to the challenge that innovation creates for them. They can only try so many things before their budget runs out so I say we look at Indie game studios. Fez a platforming game in which you play a 2d character in a 3d world in which you can snap the camera rotation based sides of a cube. Undertale a roleplaying game in which you have the option of never hurting a single enemy in the game from start to finish. Don’t starve a survival game where the primary objective is to not starve and new mechanics gradually enter the scene with little to no explanation and it is up to the player to figure it out. Thomas Was Alone a video game in which they use basic block shapes and tell a journey of their lives against a darkness. And so so many more games that I could go even further in depth too but these all came from small places and finally made a scene in a big way. So we must not just consider all indie games as bad but at least look into them further and give them a shot.</p>

                <p data-position = "left" class = "col-10 animBlock notViewed">A rising gaming platform is our mobile games. This platform has a long way before they can make a comparable amazing like those on PC and console. The most popular of the games recently has been Pok&eacute;mon go a game in which users walk around their neighborhoods in search of Pok&eacute;mon they can also leave their Pok&eacute;mon in landmarks and have them guard it for their team. Honestly, the money’s in mobile games because of the growing number of users. They are the cornerstone of the market with their addictive gameplay and their seemingly free game. We must be wary of the rise of the free to play games that are inherently built into the mobile game platform. We must help support the better mobile games of tomorrow by not being fooled to purchase the virtual currency that these games thrive off of.</p>

                <p data-position = "right" class = "col-10 animBlock notViewed floatr">Finally, we must really just look at what we are thinking about buying and trying to see if it is really worth the price. Because in this day and age all the real content is in DLC or downloadable content than the actual games sold. So I beg of you please consider what you buy before you buy.  </p>
