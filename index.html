                    We need to start to think about our effect on video games. From the games we buy to the games we don’t we are sending a message to game developers about what we want. This is why they can figure out what to make like a new COD, Halo or even a new game altogether. We have seen them taking advantage of us recently with the great pc crash of Batman: Arkham Knight where an entire game was rendered completely unplayable due to some problems with how they made the game causing it to crash continuously after 10 minutes into the game.  This was not the first nor last time game developers release a game like this. Another prime example of this was with the Assassin’s Creed series in which after a the third installment of the series took a downward spiral to become less and less polished and produced more frequently. After every iteration of the game the gameplay got glitchier and less playable having spots were the characters would fall through the map or it would cause the game to crash randomly while playing and also have moments that would corrupt the entire save game so we lost everything we have worked for. We need to start using the power we have over them, our Cash. Cash is what any company needs to survive and so if we stop buying these games especially before their are even out then we may force them to change.

                    This leads to another problem we face which is pre-ordering. Although pre-ordering was made with the best of intentions the big game developers have abused our trust of them by convincing us with their flashy commercials and snippets of gameplay to pay for a game that is not even out yet only to disappoint us with these games that are nothing more than a glitchy mess. By buying the game early the game developers create a false necessity in us in which we want the game now forcing them to cut time on polishing games to make them as glitch free as possible before the launch date. But since we have paid for them already they feel as though that it matter less about how good a game then how fast it is made.  This creates a dual trap where we as gamers want to see an amazing game but we also want the game faster than it could reasonably take. We then must always be aware that pre-ordering a game does more harm then good because it convinces the developers that they are already set and whatever they sell will be okay with the consumer.

                    We must focus on the little guys, i am talking of course of the indie game developers. These guys bring fresh ideas to the table that can only be possible with the small groups they consist of. These guys have all the control of how there games are going to be and how they are going to work because they’re usually really small games with a high replay value. So we must all support the good indie games that come out and not just immediately dismiss them as just a one hit wonder as so often we do. We need to help this community of small developers grow into a grand ecosystem that it can be where new ideas are tested and we can finally see what a game can truly be.

                    We have seen this evolution especially with the mobile gaming that we so often deny legitimacy. They are games just differently made and made with a different purpose. From the pokemon goes to the candy crush all these games are still legitimate players in the arena of mobile games. We must all realize that we control how games are made marketed and designed. So please i urge you to think about what you are supporting when you buy your next game and to make sure to support the right people doing the right thing.
