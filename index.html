From the games we buy to the games we don’t we are sending a message to game developers about what we want. This is How they decide what to make like a new COD, Halo or even a new game altogether.</p>

                 <p  data-position = "left" class = "col-10 notViewed animBlock floatl">Lately, We have seen them taking advantage of us recently with Batman: Arkham Knight where an entire game was rendered completely unplayable due to some problems with how they made the game causing it to crash continuously after 10 minutes into the game or even when it started . This situation was further worsened by the fact that they pushed the game's release date back a whole 2 months beforehand to ensure this wouldn’t be an issue. </p>
