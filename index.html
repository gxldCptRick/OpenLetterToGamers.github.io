                    We need to think about our effect on the games. Everything we do from the games we buy to the ones we don't is a direct response to the game development community, it is why they can tell whether or not to make a new Halo , a new COD or even a new game altogether. This is why even when we complain about these games they won't listen, Our money is louder than words. We need to utilize this so we can force them to see that they are going to need to make a better game or at least take to time to polish it more. I'm not trying to say that all games being made today are bad but a great majority end up being a glitchy and sometimes unplayable mess. We also need to realize that the effect of always wanting the new game now forces companies to speed up production times and thus causes glitches to appear more frequently. We need to show these developers that we as customers will be able to wait for the better games and we shouldn't encourage yearly games by pre-ordering them year after year the minute that they become available. Pre-ordering is actually leading us into more problems where the developers put in less work because they already have the money. We need to unite together and boycott pre-orders because this pattern will only continue unless we stop it. This will stop publishers from either rushing the game or not even producing the game that was promised. But not all game developers that are bad, look at Nintendo for instance. They are a giant video game company and they put an extra focus on all games they make to be exactly what the fans want. their motto is "we make games people don't return" showing you how they emphasize the importance of good games within their consoles. They are the ones who make sure good games come to us even if they are just extensions on an already made game. We lastly need to remember that a good game can come from anyplace and not dismiss the indie game community. This growing community is one way that we can get truly original games because the indie game devs have greater freedom to do what they wish because of the  small groups they are made from. These individuals have the ability to scrap an idea because they don't have to get many people to switch gears at once. So we need to help these people by supporting the ones that work hard to make the games we love. In closing, we need to think about our purchases and not rush to pre-order so quickly because those pre-orders may very well ruin the games we love.
